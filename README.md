Story
1. 1 week ago, I know nothing about using Angular, typescript, and webscraping as I was mainly focused on React for Jacascript.
2. I received our email about the assessment and challenged myself to learn something new.
3. On the first day, I learned the basics - Typescript, and Angular on the 2nd to 3rd day. On the 4th day until today, I did the assessment project.
4. While learning, I was getting the logic but not the deepest part of it. I am a fast learner and I know that I learned something big on this project.
5. The code is functional but is limited to a few products in a page. I was not able to emplement Puppeteer on my code due to limited time.
